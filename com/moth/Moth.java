// Develop the class Moth in a package that models a moth flying along a straight line. 
// A moth has a position determined by its coordinates with respect to an origin and the distance from the origin. 
// Provide getter and setter method for position and distance of the moth. Override the toString method of the Object class. 
// When a moth moves toward a point of light, its new position is halfway between its old position and the position of the light source. 
// Supply a constructor to initialize the position of a moth and the methods to move a moth toward light and to retrieve the current position of the moth. 
// Develop the MothTester class in another package containing the main method and it should construct a moth, move it toward a couple of light sources, and check the mothâ€™s position.

// Path: MothTester.java
