// A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an 
// additional  $0.50  per  hour  for  each  hour or part  thereof  in  excess  of  three  hours.  The  maximum  charge 
// for  any  given  24-hour  period  is  $10.00.  Assume  that  no  car  parks  for  longer  than  24  hours  at  a  time. 
// Write  an  application  that  calculates  and  displays  the parking  charges  for each  customer  who  parked  in 
// the garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. The program should display 
// the  charge  for  the  current  customer  and  should  calculate  and  display  the  running  total  of  yesterdayâ€™s 
// receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer.
